## O3DE Gamejam Project - Gnomebody's Home
### By Joshua Rainbolt

#### Overview
Gnomebodys home is a O3DE game jam project that I created to test the user experience of O3DE. As a UX designer at Amazon we believe in the concept of dogfooding. To put ourselves in our customers place and see how we feel. This ability to understand how our customers experience our software is important part of making great software. It's kind of like method acting, except a little less concerning as a spectator. As UX designers, we spend a lot of time talking to customers, however the ability to actually feel their pain points really changes our perception of the experience. It helps locate those repetitive behaviors or pesky notifications that customers report as annyoying. So the O3DE UX team does just that. For one week annually, we take our product and try to make something fun we can share with the community even if the outcome is a bit corky and playful. We spend our time trying to make a new game but our true outcome is the tickets or bugs that we find with our difficult experiences. We then log all the amazing issues and cross compaire them against our customer findings so we can see the overlap. 

What is left over is some amazing content that we hope the community finds fun, entertaining, and reusable for their own products. I'm looking forward to what you guys use it for. Many thanks and Enjoy!

#### Game Premise

These gnomes have come into our world and stolen all our gold. They thought they could hide it where no one would ever find it. But we've found their home. Will you help us sneak into their world and get our gold back? You have to be careful though, these gnomes are clevar and left traps for you everywhere. They also don't appear to be gone for long, so be back before the time runs out because at this point, Gnome-bodys home.


#### Whats included in the Project.
The UX workflow I was focusing on was around asset importing and assets manipulation Pipeline. With the new addition of Atom render we wanted to test out how these new workflow would effect our users. What the O3DE UX group would call the week one experience.  I focused on the level designer and asset creation workflow. So this project has 40+ assets I created in Maya, Photoshop, Illustrator. This world doesn't include any game logic or ScriptCanvas. I've removed all the prefab containers I was testing with to keep it simple.
