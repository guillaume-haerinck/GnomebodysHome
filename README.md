# Gnomebody's Home (By Joshua Rainbolt)

![gameplay](overview.gif?raw=true)

These gnomes have come into our world and stolen all our gold. They thought they could hide it where no one would ever find it. But we've found their home. Will you help us sneak into their world and get our gold back? You have to be careful though, these gnomes are clever and left traps for you everywhere. They also don't appear to be gone for long, so be back before the time runs out because at this point, Gnome-bodys home.

*This project does not have interaction besides camera movements for now*

## Prerequisites

You need to build or [install O3DE engine](https://o3de.org/download/).

You need to [install git with lfs support](https://git-scm.com/downloads), and [setup a token on your github account](https://www.docs.o3de.org/docs/welcome-guide/setup/setup-from-github/#configure-credentials-for-git-lfs). Needed as the repository uses Git LFS, the "Download ZIP" button will not download assets.

## How to run

1. Clone the github repository (`git clone https://github.com/o3de/GnomebodysHome.git`). When prompted to authenticate, use your github username and the token as password.
2. Launch O3DE. It will open the Project manager. Click on the **New Project** button then **Open Existing Project** option.
3. Navigate to the cloned repository. Open the folder. The project should now be registered.

4. Click on the **Build Project** button, located on the **GameJam2021** image.
5. Once the project has been built successfully, use the **Open Editor** button.
6. The asset pre-processor will run for a bit. Once it is over you will be welcomed with the **Open a Level** window. Pick the first one.
